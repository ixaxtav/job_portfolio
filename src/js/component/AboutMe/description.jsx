						Iâ€™ve been always been the kind of person that goes
						towards the challenges that are meaningful to me in some
						type of way . I always strive to learn, to try something
						new, to become a better version of myself every single
						day and to expand my creativity to a level that is
						unmeasurable. Although my professional path has taken so
						many twists and turns from being kid that wanted to be a
						professional player, to a university student that wanted
						to pursue the medical path, to now a driven full stack
						web developer.
						<br />
						<br />
						The reason I decided to become a web developer was
						because this careers match my personality, I adore the
						details behind the creation of any app. My mission is to
						be more engage in the programing field and work close to
						a high growth company that are interested for a software
						developer.
