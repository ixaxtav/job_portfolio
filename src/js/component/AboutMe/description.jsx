					the challenges that are meaningful to me in some type of way

					professional path has taken so many twists and turns from
					being kid that wanted to be a professional player, to a
					university student that wanted to pursue the medical path,
					to now a driven full stack web developer.
					<br />
					<br />
					The reason I decided to become a web developer was because
					this careers match my personality, I adore the details
					behind the creation of any app. My mission is to be more
					engage in the programing field and work close to a high
